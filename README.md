# Watsonx-Travel-Agent# Travel Planner Agent

Hi! This is my mini project called **Travel Planner Agent** that I did as part of my IBM Cloud Internship.

It helps users plan their trip using AI. The user gives some basic details like:
- Where they want to go
- How many days the trip is
- Their budget
- Interests (like food, beaches, shopping, etc.)

Then, the AI creates a full travel plan with places to visit, activities, food suggestions, and tips.

## What this project does:

- Takes user input (destination, days, budget, interests)
- Shows simple weather (randomly picked)
- Uses AI to create a travel plan (with OpenAI)
- Optionally uses a small dataset of cities and places
